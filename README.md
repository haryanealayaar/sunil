    Face Recognition Project:-

This project demonstrates a face recognition system using Python and several popular machine learning libraries.

How it Works:

The system follows these steps:

1. Loads Face Images: It loads face images from a specified directory on your Google Drive.

2. Preprocesses Images: Each image is converted to grayscale and resized to a standard size (300x300 pixels). The image data is then flattened into a vector.

3. Applies PCA (Principal Component Analysis): This technique reduces the dimensionality of the image data while retaining the most important features (often called "eigenfaces").

4. Applies LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis): This method further transforms the data to maximize the separation between different classes (individuals).

5. Trains an MLP Classifier: A Multi-Layer Perceptron (a type of neural network) is trained on the processed image data to learn to classify faces.

6. Evaluates the Model: The trained model is used to predict the identity of faces in a test set, and the accuracy of the predictions is calculated.

7. Visualizes Results: The project displays some of the test images along with their predicted and true identities and the confidence of the prediction.


* Requirements:
  
1. Python Libraries: matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, opencv-python

2. Google Colab (or a similar environment with Google Drive access)

3.A dataset of face images organized in folders, where each folder represents a different person.


* Setup:
  
1.Mount Google Drive: Run the provided code cell to mount your Google Drive.

2. Specify Dataset Path: Update the path and dir_name variables in the code to point to the location of your face image dataset on Google Drive.

3.Run the Notebook: Execute the code cells in order.


* Code Overview:
  
plot_gallery: A helper function to display images in a grid.

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Code to load images from your specified directory, 
resize them, and prepare them for the models.

Data Splitting: Splits the data into training and testing sets.

PCA and LDA: Applies dimensionality reduction techniques.

MLP Classifier: Trains the face recognition model.

Prediction and Evaluation: Makes predictions on the test set and calculates accuracy.

Result Visualization: Displays test images with predictions.

* Output:
  
The notebook will output:

The shapes of the processed data arrays.
The number of samples, features, and classes.
A gallery of the top "eigenfaces".
The loss during the MLP training process.
The accuracy of the face recognition model on the test set.
A gallery of test images with prediction results and probabilities.

    Student Performance Indicator Project:-
This project explores how different factors affect student test scores. We look at things like:

1. Gender: Are there differences in scores between male and female students?

2. Race/Ethnicity: Does a student's racial or ethnic background play a role?

3. Parental Education: Does the level of education of a student's parents matter?

4. Lunch: Does having a standard lunch or a free/reduced lunch affect scores?

5. Test Preparation: Does taking a test preparation course make a difference?

6. Scores: We analyze math, reading, and writing scores.

* What I did:

1. Loaded the data: i started by loading the student data from a CSV file.

2. Checked the data: I looked for missing information and duplicates to make sure the data was clean. We also checked the types of data (like numbers or text) and how many unique values were in each column.

3. Calculated scores: I added up the math, reading, and writing scores to get a total score and then calculated the average score for each student.

4. Visualized the data: I created charts to see how the average scores were distributed and how they related to different factors like gender, lunch type, and parental education.

5. Built a model: I used the data to build a machine learning model that can predict student performance based on the other factors.

6. Evaluated the model: I checked how well our model made predictions.


* Key Findings:

1. Female students tended to perform better than male students on average.

2. Students who had a standard lunch generally performed better on exams.

3. Parental education seemed to have less impact on female students' performance, but male students with parents who had associate's or master's degrees tended to perform better.

4. Math, reading, and writing scores are highly correlated with each other.

* How to use this project:

You can run the code in this notebook to see how we performed the analysis and built the model. The code includes steps for data loading, cleaning, visualization, and model training.
